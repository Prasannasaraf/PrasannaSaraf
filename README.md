Hi! I'm Prasanna Saraf, a senior consultant at Thoughtworks. I have over 8 years of experience in the software industry, and I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Scala, Spark, Golang, and Akka.

I'm passionate about big data, distributed architecture, and artificial intelligence. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

 I'm also a strong believer in giving back to the community. I am new to open source development, but I am eager to get involved. I am looking for projects that I can contribute to and learn from. I am also looking to connect with other developers who are passionate about open source.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, watching cricket, and binge-watching shows. 

I am excited to collaborate on some exciting projects on GitHub!
